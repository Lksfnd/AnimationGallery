# Animations
Hey there, this is my personal list of animations and games I made for myself to learn JavaScript whenever i was borded.  
Feel free to try them out, download it and edit, but if you want to share it, please include a link to this GitHub repository or my GitHub profile.
  
 As of now, all animations are programmed without the use of any frameworks and are compatible with all modern HTML5 browsers.  
 Since I didn't plan on sharing these animations, I didn't test them for other browsers than chrome.  
 If you find a bug or want to submit optimisations, feel free to send a new pull request.
